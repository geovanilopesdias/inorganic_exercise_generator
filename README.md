# Inorganic Chemistry Exercise Generator
**Abstract**: given an inputted number n, it generates a .txt file with n randomly with a chosen type of Inorganic Chemistry exercises (in Portuguese).

## Background
Originally written as the "original.py" script, I recently refactored it in diferent modules in order to clean it.
Here, it's possible to have some classes and methods to generate simple stoichiometry exercises (already implemented), but only with neutralization reactions in simple statements for now.

It'll be implemented another reactions (as hydrocarbon combustions and) as there's already in the original script, as well as naming exercises (as inorganic acids).

.py file to be uploaded...
